# Document Extraction API

## Why? 
In the world of document processing, developers and businesses often face significant challenges when trying to extract text from invoices, receipts, and business cards. Traditional methods require:

Complex Azure API configurations
Creating and managing Azure accounts
Understanding intricate API documentation
